## Install the application

If you **do not** have Ruby on your computer, follow these instructions to [download and install](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

Then:

- Clone the repositry files to your computer from the remote repositry here: https://github.com/jeremytuesley/StudyAssistant

- In the terminal command line, navigate to where you saved the directory you just cloned

- If you do not have the 'bundler' gem installed on your computer, please enter the following code.
 
```code
install bundler
```

- Once completed, to install the program, type this command into your terminal: 

```code
./StudyAssistant_install.sh
```
*If this doesn't work, **first**, check if you are in the correct directory (where you cloned the repositry to), **second** ensure all files from the repositry are there (cross match with github)*

- Once installed, the application will prompt if you wish to launch from the installer. Type in 'y' or 'n'

- If 'n' or if you have exited the game after installing
To now run the program, in your terminal, please type:
```code
./StudyAssistant.sh
```
